socket.broadcast.emit() & socket.emit() are used to send a signal & socket.on() receives it. Both are related to one another & work in conjunction.

The difference between broadcast.emit() & emit() is that the former sends a signal to every client except the client that initiated the event.
emit() send a signal to all the clients, including the one that initiated the event.

While running the project, start the server first:
nodemon nodeServer/index.js

Then start the client live server on the default port 5500
